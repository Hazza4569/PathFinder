# PathFinder

This program was created for my third-year undergraduate module 'Object
Oriented Programming in C++'.  The application uses the Qt framework to create
a GUI to allow the user to set up a 'maze' to be solved by a pathfinding
algorithm. The project files were built with QtCreator.

One of the key concepts was the use of polymorphic design to include two
different geometries of grid, square and hexagonal, in which the maze could be
set up.

The associated report I wrote for this project can be found
[here](docs/report.pdf). I was awarded a grade of 96% for this module.
